  abstract = {This paper discusses the importance of recycling in Solid waste Management. Cities in the world are rapidly urbanising and rapid population increase, As world population grows so does the solid waste generation increases as well. This resulted in a relatively large quantity of solid waste remaining poorly managed and challenge to the society, Today society is more concerned about the environment and is much more aware about its activities and the impact resulting from these activities on the environment. Society demands that waste management must be sustainable. The proper management of solid waste needs appropriate technology, which is economically affordable, socially accepted and environmentally friendly. The paper deals with the idea of recycling as a means of solid waste treatment and explores whether such an approach is commendable or not. The purpose of presenting this paper is to share experience with other countries on the needs and importance of the recycling.},

  abstract = {In order to gain a better understanding of the attitudes and behaviour of a campus community toward a university concourse-based recycling scheme, a survey of 1400 students and staff, at Massey University, New Zealand was conducted. A written questionnaire focused on how recycling participation and source separation performance might be improved, and on general attitudes within the university community toward recycling. The recycling scheme was generally well supported, with predominantly positive recycling attitudes and self-reported recycling behaviour indicated for both students and staff. The major suggested improvement to the concourse system was to have better signage in more appropriate places, and there was strong support for extension of the recycling scheme across the wider campus. Significant relationships were found between self-reported recycling behaviour and attitudes toward recycling, self-reported recycling behaviour and campus occupation (student, postgraduate student, academic staff, or general staff) and self-reported recycling behaviour and place of work.},
