  abstract = {This paper discusses the importance of recycling in Solid waste Management. Cities in the world are rapidly urbanising and rapid population increase, As world population grows so does the solid waste generation increases as well. This resulted in a relatively large quantity of solid waste remaining poorly managed and challenge to the society, Today society is more concerned about the environment and is much more aware about its activities and the impact resulting from these activities on the environment. Society demands that waste management must be sustainable. The proper management of solid waste needs appropriate technology, which is economically affordable, socially accepted and environmentally friendly. The paper deals with the idea of recycling as a means of solid waste treatment and explores whether such an approach is commendable or not.
